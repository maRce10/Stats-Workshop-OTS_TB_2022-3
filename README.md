Traditionally, statistical models have been taught as disconnected tools
with no clear relationship between them. However, most of those common
statistical models are just special cases of linear models. Hence,
learning them as such can largely simplify things. The course will focus
on linear regression as the main tool for statistical inference.
Students will be introduced to the basic elements of a linear regression
model, its interpretation, as well as hands-on experience on building
those models in R.

### Objectives

-   Understand statistical inference through a single modelling tool
    (broad sense linear models)

-   Get familiar with building linear models

-   Extent linear models to different data structures
